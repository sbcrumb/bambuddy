# Changelog

All notable changes to Bambuddy will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Add to Queue from File Manager** - Queue sliced files directly from File Manager:
  - New "Add to Queue" toolbar button appears when sliced files are selected
  - Context menu and list view button options for individual files
  - Supports multiple file selection for batch queueing
  - Only accepts sliced files (.gcode or .gcode.3mf)
  - Creates archive and queue item in one action
- **Print Queue plate selection and options** - Full print configuration in queue edit modal:
  - Plate selection grid with thumbnails for multi-plate 3MF files
  - Print options section (bed levelling, flow calibration, vibration calibration, layer inspect, timelapse, use AMS)
  - Options saved with queue item and used when print starts
- **Multi-plate 3MF plate selection** - When reprinting multi-plate 3MF files (exported with "All sliced file"), users can now select which plate to print:
  - Plate selection grid with thumbnails, names, and print times
  - Filament requirements filtered to show only selected plate's filaments
  - Prevents incorrect filament mapping across plates
  - Closes [#93](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/93)
- **Home Assistant smart plug integration** - Control any Home Assistant switch/light entity as a smart plug:
  - Configure HA connection (URL + Long-Lived Access Token) in Settings → Network
  - Add HA-controlled plugs via Settings → Plugs → Add Smart Plug → Home Assistant tab
  - Entity dropdown shows all available switch/light/input_boolean entities
  - Full automation support: auto-on, auto-off, scheduling, power alerts
  - Works alongside existing Tasmota plugs
  - Closes [#91](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/91)
- **Fusion 360 design file attachments** - Attach F3D files to archives for complete design tracking:
  - Upload F3D files via archive context menu ("Upload F3D" / "Replace F3D")
  - Cyan badge on archive card indicates attached F3D file (next to source 3MF badge)
  - Click badge to download, or use "Download F3D" in context menu
  - F3D files included in backup/restore
  - API tests for F3D endpoints

### Fixed
- **Multi-plate 3MF metadata extraction** - Single-plate exports from multi-plate projects now show correct thumbnail and name:
  - Extracts plate index from slice_info.config metadata
  - Uses correct plate thumbnail (e.g., plate_5.png instead of plate_1.png)
  - Appends "Plate N" to print name for plates > 1
  - Closes [#92](https://github.com/maziggy/bambuddy/issues/92)

  - Topics: printer status, print lifecycle, AMS changes, queue events, maintenance alerts, smart plug states, archive events
- **Virtual Printer Queue Mode** - New mode that archives files and adds them directly to the print queue:
  - Three modes: Archive (immediate), Review (pending list), Queue (print queue)
  - Queue mode creates unassigned items that can be assigned to a printer later
- **Unassigned Queue Items** - Print queue now supports items without an assigned printer:
  - "Unassigned" filter option on Queue page
  - Unassigned items highlighted in orange
  - Assign printer via edit modal
